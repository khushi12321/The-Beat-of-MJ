THE BEAT OF MJ - A fan tribute to the king of pop

‚ÄúThe beat of MJ‚Äù is a fanpage website dedicated to the most iconic entertainer of the 1900s, Micheal Jackson, who revolutionized the English pop music industry through his songs, stages and fashion. Often dubbed as the ‚ÄúKing of Pop‚Äù, from the Moonwalk to the Anti-Gravity lean, his artistry continues to inspire generations of music and dance lovers.
The website will celebrate his music, dance, and cultural impact by including sections such as biography, album, videos, and  gallery. Along the way, you‚Äôll also discover fun, interactive sections that introduce you to us, the passionate developers bringing this tribute to life.

This idea for this website was discussed by a team of three members:
- Khushi Shrestha (Git Manager, Team lead) -- https://github.com/khushi12321
- Sichu Maharjan (UI/UX Designer) -- https://github.com/Sichu-Maharjan
- Aviyaan Shrestha (Content Manager) -- https://github.com/aviiii26

We researched for a suitable available template for our website idea online and found one on [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog). After which, we changed the source code along with certain elements and added a few things to make the template our own. 
The website is still in DEVELOPMENT PHASE!

GIT
